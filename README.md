# Zappa Quest 2

Zappa Quest 2 (working title) is a SNES style turn-based RPG, similar to the Final Fantasy or Dragon Quest series.  
In this playable demo, the player controls the main character Zappa as they explore a procedurally generated dungeon 
and fight monsters along the way.  The game ends if the player defeats the final boss or if the player is defeated.
